# Voice-Assistant
A simple Voice Assistant.
SpeechRecognition library to convert speech-to-text.
gTTs library in order to convert text-to-speech.
Then I used winsound to play the audio file (pydub to convert .mp3 to .wav)
Other libraries were added as needed for the Voice Assistant to carry out various tasks
